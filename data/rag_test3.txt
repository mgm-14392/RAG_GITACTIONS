Story 3: The Painter’s Curse

In a bustling city, an artist named Victor gained fame for his hyper-realistic paintings. People marveled at his ability to capture not just an image but a soul. Yet, Victor harbored a dark secret—each time he painted someone’s portrait, the subject lost a piece of themselves. Their laughter dulled, their passions faded, and they became hollow echoes of who they once were. Unaware of the cause, clients flocked to him, desperate to be immortalized in his art. One day, Victor met a blind musician named Elena, who requested a portrait. As he painted, he felt something shift—his own emotions dulled, his creativity waned. For the first time, he realized the curse worked both ways. Terrified, he destroyed the painting, and in doing so, freed not just himself but all his past subjects. From that day on, he never painted another soul, instead dedicating his life to creating art that breathed life into the world rather than taking it away.
